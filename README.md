# Welcome to Pablo's Temporary Playground

I intend on using this as a temporary copy of Addison's new tanuki backend project. Later on I hope to merge this branch and tanuki_backend to the master.
I think that we can get rid of the master and Addison_Django branches since they were for just learning Django.
