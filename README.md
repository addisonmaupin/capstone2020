# ECEN Senior Design Spring 2020 - Fall 2020
The repository for the ECEN 403-404 Senior Design Project at Texas A&amp;M University.

Tanuki is a budgeting website built in Python using the Django framework with a PostgreSQL database. The master branch contains the most up-to-date version of the project.

This project consists of four apps: the login app, the overview app, the budget app, and the history app. The login app is responsible for authenticating users, registering new users, and logging users out. The overview app displays the home page which shows the current week and all purchasing information. The budget app allows users to set their specic budget for the month and add in any fixed expenses (bills, rent, etc). The history app shows every item the user has purchased.  

This project has been deployed on Google Cloud and can be accessed at: https://tanuki-58.uc.r.appspot.com/
